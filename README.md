# MetroNav

The Delhi MetroPathFinder project is a Java-based application that aims to provide an efficient path finding solution for navigating the Delhi Metro system. It utilizes various shortest path finding algorithms to determine the most optimal route between two specified metro stations.

This Java program is designed to assist users in finding the shortest route and fare information between source and destination stations in the Delhi Metro system. It utilizes graph and heap data structures, where nodes represent metro stations and edges represent distances and costs. By implementing algorithms like Dijkstra, breadth-first search, and depth-first search, the program determines the optimal path and calculates the fare based on the total distance. It also provides a metro map for easy navigation. Users can input their desired stations, and the program will display the shortest route and fare details.

By implementing these features, the Delhi MetroPathFinder project aims to simplify the process of navigating the extensive Delhi Metro network, helping commuters and tourists efficiently plan their metro travel by identifying the shortest and most convenient routes.
